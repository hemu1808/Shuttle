Built full-stack ticket booking app without AWS
Used Node.js, React, React Native, MongoDB, Firebase, Razorpay
Added real-time WebSocket seat locking
Ready to migrate to AWS later

Replace MongoDB with DynamoDB.
Move Auth to AWS Cognito.
Deploy Backend as AWS Lambda.
Use Amplify Hosting for Web.

techstack:
Backend: Node.js (Express.js) with MongoDB (or PostgreSQL)
Authentication: Firebase Auth or Passport.js
Database: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas) or PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
Real-time Updates: WebSockets with Socket.io
Payments: Razorpay/Stripe
Frontend: React (Web) and React Native (Mobile)

1	Install tools, configure AWS Amplify - Install Dependencies
2	Add authentication (AWS Cognito) & GraphQL API (AWS AppSync) - Create Authentication (Firebase or Passport.js)
3	Set up UI for Web (React + Tailwind CSS) & Mobile (React Native/Flutter) - Develop the Frontend (React + React Native)
4	Implement real-time seat locking & WebSocket updates - Connect WebSockets in Frontend
5	Integrate Razorpay/Stripe for secure payments - Handle Payments in Frontend
6	Deploy Web (AWS Amplify) & Mobile (Google Play/App Store)
7	Add AI recommendations & dynamic pricing(optional)

Idea- 
Shuttle Now – Real-Time Ticket Booking System
Tech Stack: React, AWS Amplify, AppSync (GraphQL), DynamoDB, WebSockets, Stripe, Tailwind CSS, AWS S3
Architected a full-stack real-time ticket booking system using AWS services, providing a seamless and scalable solution for event-based seat reservations.
Implemented AWS Amplify Authentication (Cognito) to enable secure user sign-up/sign-in, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and session management.
Designed and developed a GraphQL API using AWS AppSync for efficient data fetching, real-time updates, and optimized queries on a DynamoDB database.
Engineered a real-time seat availability mechanism using WebSockets (AppSync Subscriptions) to ensure immediate seat-locking updates, preventing double bookings.
Developed a dynamic pricing engine that adjusts ticket prices based on demand and availability using predictive algorithms, enhancing revenue optimization.
Integrated Stripe/Razorpay payment gateway to securely process transactions, handling payment tokenization, webhooks, and secure endpoints with AWS Lambda.
Designed and optimized the database schema in DynamoDB, structuring collections for users, events, seats, and bookings, ensuring high performance and scalability.
Implemented AI-powered seat recommendations that analyze user preferences (aisle/window, group booking proximity) to enhance the booking experience.
Built a countdown-based seat locking system where selected seats are temporarily unavailable for a few minutes until payment is confirmed, releasing them if the session expires.
Deployed AWS S3 for image storage, allowing seamless event image uploads with optimized retrieval and access management.
Developed a modern, responsive UI using React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean and smooth booking experience across devices.
Configured AWS Amplify Hosting for automatic deployments, leveraging CI/CD workflows to push updates efficiently.
Ensured robust security by implementing SSL/TLS encryption, AWS IAM policies, and best practices to protect sensitive user data and transactions.

Base-
Architecture: The app needs a front-end (for user interactions) and a back-end (for managing data and real-time updates). Consider using React or Flutter for the front-end and Node.js, Django, or Flask for the back-end.
Database Design: To handle bookings efficiently, design tables for tickets, users, events, and payments. Using a real-time database like Firebase or adding WebSocket connections can help keep seat availability updated in real time.
Real-Time Availability: Implement a locking mechanism to prevent double-booking, where once a user initiates booking a seat, it’s locked for a few minutes until the payment is complete.
Payment Gateway Integration: Research options like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal. Each has SDKs that integrate well with mobile and web apps. Configure secure endpoints and ensure data protection with SSL.
Goal: A ticket booking system that manages real-time seat availability and securely processes payments.
Step 1: Setting Up the Backend Infrastructure
Tech Stack: Use Node.js with Express.js or Django (Python) as they handle concurrency well, essential for real-time updates.
Database: Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for ticketing data. MongoDB offers flexibility for unstructured data, while PostgreSQL provides strong relational support if your data is more structured.
WebSocket Server: For real-time updates, integrate WebSocket connections using Socket.IO with Node.js or Django Channels with Django.
Step 2: Building a Scalable Database Schema
User Profiles: Store user details with fields for booking history, preferences, and secure payment data (tokenized, never storing raw card data).
Event/Ticket Schema: Design tables for events, seats, booking status, and timestamps. A sample schema might include:
Event: ID, name, date, location, etc.
Seat: EventID, seat number, price, isAvailable (boolean).
Booking: UserID, EventID, SeatID, payment status, timestamp.
Real-Time Locking: Create a “lock” on selected seats to prevent double-booking. When a user initiates booking, mark seats as temporarily unavailable.
Step 3: Developing the Frontend
UI Framework: Use React or Flutter for the front-end. Both frameworks offer flexible component-based architectures and good compatibility with real-time data.
Real-Time Updates: Implement a countdown timer for each booking session, visually displaying when seats are locked but not confirmed.
Security & UX: Use HTTPS and secure cookies. Design a clear, intuitive interface with smooth transitions for a seamless booking experience.
Step 4: Payment Gateway Integration
Gateway Choice: Stripe or Razorpay are popular options with secure APIs for web and mobile applications.
Integration:
Generate payment tokens client-side.
Implement secure server-side endpoints to handle payment processing.
After successful payment, confirm seat booking and store booking details.
Security: Use SSL/TLS, avoid storing raw card information, and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.
Step 5: Unique Additions to Stand Out
AI-Powered Seat Recommendations: Use a simple recommender algorithm that suggests seats based on user preferences (proximity, aisle preference, etc.).
Dynamic Pricing Engine: Build a pricing model that adjusts ticket prices based on demand and supply in real time.
